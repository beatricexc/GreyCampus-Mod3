Linear Regression is used for predictive analysis
- when there is a growth in y, there is a growth in x and viceversa (sales/marketing..when the marketing increases, the sales increase as well)
- it is always the dependent which changes based on the independent values (logic!)
- we call it linear regression every time there is a change in x with repect to y
- parallel lines are not linear regressions x || o , where o is the fitted line

### Types of Linear Regression
They are mostly defined by 3 parameters: 
1. the number of independent variables
2. shape of the regression line (size) - spread of the data 
3. Type of dependent variables

- Polynomyial : when the data points have a curve at the edge, we use polynomial

- Logistic Regression works with binomial distribution 
                      
        
        
- Quantile Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- Principal Component Regression (PCR)
